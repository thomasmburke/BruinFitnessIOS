Warnings to investigate:
- TableView warning

UI nice to haves:
- fix card closing animation to not jump to top of list item space
    - others talking about the same issue: https://www.reddit.com/r/SwiftUI/comments/e2jgnz/expandable_swiftui_list_row_with_animation/
    - fixed with fast or no animation
- buttonStyle currently stops card from flashing white, but only allows the chevron to be pressed. Ideally this would be the entire card
- Is @Binding more appropriate to the schedule filter?
- use TextFields to add workout cards to the database for admins
